# etch-a-sketch

This project is a demonstration of my skills with html, css and js. It incorporates a fair amount of user input, styling, DOM manipulation, event listeners--amongst other things.

In this etch-a-sketch project, the user can create a grid, or canvas, of a specified number pixels and paint by hovering over the canvas. The user can choose colors to paint with. And lastly, the canvas can be reset back to white/transparent.

The most challenging feature was the incremental opacity and color/opacity combining. This feature allows the user to "paint," combining the primary colors at different opacities to create new colors.
